So, you will meet a people with some of the British reserve, with many British methods and institutions, but with American outspokenness and directness&mdash;plus a working knowledge of American slang.</p>
          <p class="heading"><span>What You Will Find.</span> To begin with, you&rsquo;ll find a warm welcome awaiting you. The New Zealanders are a hospitable people who enjoy having visitors in their country and guests in their homes. They like Americans and have enjoyed meeting the U.S. troops that have preceded you. They appreciate the help that we have been able to send them but whatever you do, don&rsquo;t get the idea that you are going there to protect a helpless people. The New Zealanders are doing their full share in this war and have been in there pitching since 1939. They are already fully mobilized. They have drafted married men, for instance, up to age 40, regardless of the number of children they have.

When you cross Cook Strait to the South Island you will find the mountain peaks and skiing of Switzerland; the green lawns and hedges of England, an arid dusty region in Central Otago as dry as the deserts of Libya or Arizona; and away to the South, fiords as beautiful as those in Norway.</p>
          <p class="heading"><span>What You Won&rsquo;t Find.</span> You will not find some of the things you have been accustomed to at home. For instance, you will not find central heating in private homes. There are few hotels of the luxury class and few night clubs. You will run quickly into what the New Zealanders themselves call the &ldquo;Blue Laws&rdquo; which close bars, dance halls, movies, and theaters on Sunday, except for certain movies which are allowed open for members of the Armed Forces. These you can visit in uniform and you can take two civilians with you (that is to enable you to take her mother along as well).
