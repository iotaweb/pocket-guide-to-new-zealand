Pocket Guide to New Zealand
===========================

The &ldquo;Pocket Guide to New Zealand&rdquo; was given to American G.I.s during the Second World War before visiting New Zealand. Converting this guide to a website provided an excellent opportunity to play around with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) for Mac and try out Stylus (dynamic CSS) and Jade (a templating language for Node.js, but can also be used for static sites).

CodeKit made it easy to compile the static files and assets above from the included source files (/src). A CodeKit configuration file is included for those who wish to reproduce this site.
