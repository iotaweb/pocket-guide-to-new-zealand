          <h2>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</h2>
          <p class="noindent">THESE are practically the same as ours, but they use the &ldquo;imperial gallon.&rdquo; This makes their gallons, quarts, and pints about one-fifth larger than ours. Their bushels are also a little larger than the corresponding American units.</p>
          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p class="noindent">YOU&rsquo;RE going to like New Zealand and its people. American troops that have preceded you have made plenty of firm friends and thereby paved the way for you. You&rsquo;ll soon feel at home, particularly if you remember from the beginning that you have plenty to learn, especially from the New Zealanders themselves. No warnings are needed by any man of common sense and good will.</p>
          <p>Always remember that it will take mutual cooperation to win the war, and <em>mutual understanding</em> to win the peace. If you make friends wherever you go, you are not only doing a fine job for yourself and your country, but for humanity and the future of the world.</p><img src="assets/img/tree-fern-half.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="59">

It was from the bases of this northern coast, and from New Caledonia and New Zealand that the United Nations slowed the Jap drive south.</p>
