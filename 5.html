          <p>Frankly, organized entertainment is pretty scarce in New Zealand. But there are plenty of compensations. It is a country where an immense amount of fun can be had by anyone who is capable of making his own.</p>

They were Maoris, and sailed to New Zealand from Raiatea, near Tahiti, in open canoes made from hollowed-out logs, about 150 years before Columbus discovered America.</p>
          <p>In 1642 Abel Janszoon Tasman, a Dutchman of the same stock as the pioneers who founded New York, made landfall on the west coast of New Zealand. He was searching for the great southern continent which, in those days, geographers believed stretched from Australia to within a few hundred miles of the coast of</p>
