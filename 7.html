          <p>There are no striking differences between the United States and New Zealand in ordinary social life, and you should find it easy to get along. The New Zealand accent may seem strange to you so don&rsquo;t be surprised if they also smile at your accent and language. They will probably call you Yanks or Yankees, whether you come from the North or from the South, and will say you have a Yankee accent even if you speak with a South Carolina drawl. Women will be pleased, but will think it a little strange, when you say &ldquo;yes ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; to them, though men will not think it strange to hear &ldquo;yes sir.&rdquo;</p>

So you may find yourself with more spending money than most New Zealand men, whether soldiers or civilians. Don&rsquo;t toss it around. It won&rsquo;t make you popular and can very easily make for hard feelings.</p><br>
          <p class="heading"><span>The Maoris.</span> The New Zealand natives are called the Maoris, pronounced &ldquo;mow&rdquo; to rhyme with &ldquo;cow&rdquo; and &ldquo;rie.&rdquo; The correct plural is Maori but you will find most people putting an <em>s</em> on the end. These New Zealand natives are first cousins of the Hawaiians and are a proud, tough, fighting race who have won a status of complete equality with the white people in New Zealand, so never think of them or refer to them as natives or regard them as having any inferior status.</p>
