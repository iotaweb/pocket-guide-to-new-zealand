          <p>Although there are no hot dog or hamburger stands as such, you will find a New Zealand institution called the Pie Cart. This is a stand which is set up at night in one of the main squares of the town and where you can sit down and get a good cheap meal of sausages, potatoes, eggs, and other such food. But even there you won&rsquo;t find the kind of coffee you are used to. In fact, you won&rsquo;t get it anywhere except in camp, because one of the characteristics which the New Zealanders share with the British is a complete inability to make coffee.</p>
          <p>And now we come to the all-important subject of &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not simply the stuff you used to have at home. In fact, it may be more than a beverage. It may be a whole meal! So you&rsquo;d better learn a little something about it.</p>
          <p>The thing that will confuse you at first are the names given to tea-drinking occasions. There are three kinds of &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; To begin with, there is morning tea at 10 or 11 a.&nbsp;m. Then there is afternoon tea at 3 or 4 p. m., which is usually accompanied by great quantities of bread and butter, cookies, cakes, and even fruit salad. But don&rsquo;t confuse either of these two with the occasion called &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; You see, in many homes dinner is served at midday and the evening meal is called &ldquo;tea&rdquo;&mdash;or what many of us call supper in the United States.</p>
          <p>All clear so far? Then you&rsquo;ve only one more thing to</p>

          <p class="noindent">learn. When a New Zealander says &ldquo;supper&rdquo; he means refreshments served at the very end of the evening after you&rsquo;ve come home from the movies, for instance. The word is used in the same way in many parts of our own country.</p>
          <p>If you are invited to &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; perhaps the safest thing to do is to ask your host to name the hour!</p>
          <p>You&rsquo;ll immediately notice that the New Zealander also uses his knife and fork like the English, holding the fork only in the left hand and loading food onto it with his knife. Pie is eaten with a spoon or spoon and fork, while cake is usually eaten with the fingers.</p>
          <p>Outside of private homes and a few clubs, liquor can be bought only in licensed hotels, and then only during the hours from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m., Monday to Friday, and from 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. and 4 to 6 p. m. on Saturdays. No liquor is sold on Sundays. Some districts have local prohibition, but they are few and scattered.</p>
          <p>It is not the New Zealand custom to go in for long drinks such as highballs Hard liquor is served in ounce or half-ounce nips. Supplies are short and in many places practically unobtainable. Much of the beer and ale is stronger than ours and is not served so cold. Ice and ice water are not popular and you will often have to ask specially for a glass of water with your meal.</p>
