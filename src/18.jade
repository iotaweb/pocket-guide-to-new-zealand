      h2 NEW ZEALAND AND THE WAR
      p IMAGINE the United States with an Army and Navy of 13,000,000 men. Imagine on top of that a home guard of another 8,000,000. That is the number we would have to have under arms if we were to match New Zealand&rsquo;s mobilization, allowing for the difference in population between the two countries!
      p New Zealand troops, as you will quickly see for yourself, are a fine looking, sunburned, tough bunch of men, with as fine a record in this war as they had in the last.

      p You can distinguish a New Zealand soldier who has been or is going overseas by the label &ldquo;New Zealand&rdquo; he wears just below his shoulder. The bright colored patches on the sleeves indicate the different units like our own divisional badges&mdash;and the colored &ldquo;pugaree&rdquo; on his felt hat tells which branch of the service he belongs to.
      p.heading <span>Butter and Guns.</span>	Apart from their battle record the people of the country have put their shoulders into the war effort in a way that no one else has surpassed. They have kept up their farm production even though many farmers have been drafted, and they&rsquo;ve exported even larger quantities of cheese, butter, and meat to Britain during the war than before.
      p Despite the fact that all steel has to be imported, New Zealand is turning out and even exporting to the Middle East and India important quantities of small arms ammunition, grenades, light armored cars and so on. This has
