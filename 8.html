In one battle last century a Maori tribe had a British Regiment surrounded. They found that the British were running short of ammunition and food, so the Maori Chief sent in a messenger and said that they didn&rsquo;t like to fight on inferior terms and, therefore, they would send in some powder and shot and food.
